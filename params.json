It's been made by two people in less than a week. It can give you a general idea on my work efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe game was desigened base on an very interesting idea. Although it looks like a traditional dungeon game, the goal is to escape from the dungeon, but it's pitch black and the player only has a limited view distance. However darkness and light are the key factor of the game system. The weapon player use is called Shadow Sword, which would glow in the dark and become much more powerful. When a monster is killed, a bonefire is lit and illuminate the surrendings.\r\n\r\n###To play the demo: \r\nDownload the .rar and unzip.\r\n\r\nPress Enter to Start.\r\n\r\n+ W-S to Move Forward-Backword.\r\n+ Move the mouse to Rotate.\r\n+ Left_Click to Attack.\r\n\r\n###To view the source code: \r\nDownload the project folder and open with Unity.(Require Unity 5.2.2 or higher)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nMain Programmer: Dun Mao\r\n\r\nDesigner, Assistant Programmer: Valentin Serra\r\n\r\nPlease do not use this work for commercial purposes, thank you.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
